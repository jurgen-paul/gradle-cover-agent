## Source File
Here is the source file that you will be writing tests against, called `${source_file_name}`.
Note that we have manually added line numbers for each line of code, to help you understand the code coverage report.
Those numbers are not a part of the original code.
=========
${source_file_numbered}
=========

## Test File
Here is the file that contains the existing tests, called `${test_file_name}`.
=========
${test_file}
=========

### Test Framework
The test framework used for running tests is `${testing_framework}`.

#if(${additional_includes_section})
Additional includes to be added to the test file:
=========
${additional_includes_section}
=========
#end

#if(${failed_tests_section})
Here are the tests that you created that failed do not create these tests again!
=========
${failed_tests_section}
=========
#end

#if(${additional_instructions_text})
 ${additional_instructions_text}
#end

## Code Coverage
The following is the existing code coverage report. Use this to determine what tests to write, as you should only write tests that increase the overall coverage:
=========
${code_coverage_report}
=========

## Response
The output must be a JSON object following this specific json schema definition:
=====
${jsonSchema}
=====
You must write the test based on ${testing_framework} framework style, make sure the new methods are formatted for the language.

Response (must be a valid JSON, and nothing else)
